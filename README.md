# ASCII Art Creator

### A simple example program to create ascii art in your browser's console.

##### Important concepts:
  - `createRowRenderer` is a function that returns another function
  - `initCursor` and `initGameBoard` utilize closure scope to store their state
  - Both `render` and `print` use higher-order functions to do their jobs
